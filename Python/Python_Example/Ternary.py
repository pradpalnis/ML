# Program to demonstrate conditional operator 
a, b = 10, 20

# Copy value of a in min if a < b else copy b 
min = a if a < b else b 

print(min) 


# Python program to demonstrate ternary operator 
a, b = 10, 20

# Use tuple for selecting an item 
print( (b, a) [a < b] ) 

# Use Dictionary for selecting an item 
print({True: a, False: b} [a < b]) 

# lamda is more efficient than above two methods 
# because in lambda we are assure that 
# only one expression will be evaluated unlike in 
# tuple and Dictionary 
print((lambda: b, lambda: a)[a < b]())
